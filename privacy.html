<p>At Indigo, we collect and manage user data according to the following Privacy Policy, with a commitment to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Any information that you provide us with will be used only in accordance with this statement.</p>
<p>In short, we don't store your Dropbox or Chrome passwords. We don't store the contents of your files, except for extracts intended to help you remind you of the contents of documents. We use cookies only to maintain your login session.</p>

<h2 id="data-collected">Data Collected</h2>
<p>We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.</p>
<p>We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your name and email address) in order for us to be able to manage your data. In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Website, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.</p>
<p>You are able to view, change and remove your data associated with your profile. Should you choose to delete your account, please contact us at help@indigodb.com and we will follow up with such request as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to help@indigodb.com.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-the-data">Use of the Data</h2>
<p>We only use your personal information to provide you the Indigo services or to communicate with you about the services or the Website.</p>
<p>With respect to any files or bookmarks you may choose to upload to Indigo, we take the privacy and confidentiality of such documents seriously. All data is backed up and we employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.</p>
<p>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:</p>
<p>doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;
we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;
we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.</p>

<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

If we make major changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>
