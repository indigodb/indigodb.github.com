Indigo indexes your files, bookmarks and tweets to help you keep track of your research and discover relevant articles, datasets and people. So every time you bookmark a gene, tweet about a paper or store a document Indigo learns more about your research.

For example: if you collect a set of articles about malaria then Indigo can automatically generate a bibliography for your project, suggest new papers to read, and email you whenever a relevant article is published in one of the major journals.

Indigo works behind the scenes, so whenever you’re online and save a file to your Dropbox or bookmark a page in Chrome the index is updated automatically, with no manual configuration or annotation required. However, you can add tags and favourites, and browse everything on our website – making it even easier to find things when you need them.
